Can you understand the structure of this multi-branch, multi-choice, multi-ending script of mine?
Now I need you to use all of this script's structure (without adding or subtracting branches) to help me write a first-person, multi-choice, multi-branch, multi-endings social story script for a child with autism that is consistent with social storytelling therapy and the individualized characteristics of this child with autism?
The purpose of this story is to improve the social-emotional impairment of the child with autism by using social storytelling in order for this child to learn to recognize the emotion of sadness and to cope correctly with the emotion of sadness needing to learn this emotion. This story must take place in a real social scenario, no virtual stories.
Let me tell you some basic information about this child: this child is a 7-year-old boy, his language ability can only independently express simple content, can not express emotional needs, he usually like to watch some train overturned and other destructive videos, eat dessert snacks, listen to children's songs, he especially hates Learning and eating mustard.
He feels sad from physical pain and eating mustard, and when he feels sad, he rolls on the floor and scratches. The next step is to illustrate this script, now my requirement is only one picture and one sentence on a page of PowerPoint, as simple and direct as possible. These illustrations contain the story scene, story content, branching options, and ending. Each illustration needs to correspond to the story, have a bubble box with a sentence describing the image (this sentence serves as a prompt for the dalle to generate the image), can you help me organize the ppt text, bubble box text, and title of the illustrations that I need?
The format of the generated story is: first line title and serial number (e.g. first ppt: story background); second line story title; third line prompt describing the picture; fourth line bubble box text.
